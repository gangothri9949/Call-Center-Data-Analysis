📞 Call Center Data Analysis — Tableau Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze and monitor call center performance. The dashboard uncovers insights around call volume, customer sentiment, service response levels, and performance across multiple communication channels and locations.

By aggregating and visualizing call center data from multiple sources, the goal is to enable data-driven decision making to improve customer support efficiency and service quality.

🎯 Objectives

Visualize total call volume and average call duration

Analyze customer sentiment across interactions

Investigate reasons behind customer calls

Track SLA adherence using response time metrics

Compare performance across channels (Call, Email, Chat, Web)

Benchmark call center locations (Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver)

📂 Data Sources

The dashboard is built from a consolidated dataset that includes:

Source Type	Description
Call Logs	Date, time, channel, duration
Customer Transcripts	Sentiment and feedback text
Survey Responses	Satisfaction score post-interaction
SLA Metrics	Response time performance
Location Attributes	Call center branches
📊 Key Visualizations

KPI Cards — Total Calls, Avg Call Duration, Avg Satisfaction Score

Sentiment Pie Chart — Positive / Neutral / Negative distribution

Complaint Reason Bars — Billing, Payments, Service Outage trends

Response Time Analysis — Within SLA / Below SLA / Above SLA breakdown

Channel Performance Treemap — Call center vs Email vs Chatbot vs Web

Location Performance Bar Chart — City-wise traffic comparison

🧠 Business Insights

Majority of calls are related to billing questions, indicating a potential need for billing process improvements

A significant portion of calls fall within SLA, showing good operational efficiency

Negative sentiment constitutes a considerable share, suggesting a gap in issue resolution or communication tone

Los Angeles/CA handles the highest number of calls among branches

The Call-Center channel dominates over Email/Chat/Web in handling customer queries
